Bellow is a summary of the Learning How to Learn course, instructors Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski. The entire course is available at [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) and takes about 15 hours.

## Focused versus Diffuse Thinking
* Metaphors provide powerful techniques for learning
* Focused and diffuse modes (relax, let you mind flow in diffuse mode, then think in focused)
* Learning something difficult **takes time**

## Procrastination, Memory, Sleep
* Use Pomodoro technique to avoid procrastination, useful for focusing (agree, it is much easier to focus on something, I've started to use this [site](https://tomato-timer.com/) on the regular basis)
* Practice makes permanent- neurons become linked together through **repeated use**
* Long term memory & working memory
* **Spaced repetition**- repeat what you're trying to retain over a number of days, the chance to remember will be higher
* Sleep:
  * cleans toxic products in your brain
  * erases the less important parts of memories
  * strengthens areas that you need or want to remember
* Learning by doing, by active engagement and not passive listening
* Smart != success; **passion + persistence = success**

## Chunking
* **focus** on something you're learning
* **understand** the basic idea (understanding is like a glue to build and connect chunks)
* the first time you actually understand = the first time you can actually do it yourself
* learning = chunks (**how** to do something) + context (**when** to/not to use it)

## Illusions of competence
* **Recall** is the best learning technique (instead of passive readings)
* Minimize highlights- try to understand the main idea first and then highlight
* Notes and helpful words are great- add them
* Tests yourself= recall
* Interleaving is a great way to master a new subject (jump between different problems/situations, use different techniques/strategies)

## Focused learning
* Once a week write a brief weekly list of key tasks in a planner journal
* Daily "to do" list- frees working memory for problem-solving
* Make them as small as a pomodoro chunk
* Interleave (just between different topics)
* Planning your quitting time is as important as planning your working time
* Try to work on a most important and most disliked task first
